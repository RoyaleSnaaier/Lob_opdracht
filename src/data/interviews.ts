    title: 'Rethinking Economic Education for the 21st Century',
    interviewee: 'Dr. Sophia Martinez',
    role: 'Professor of Economics at Global University',
    excerpt: 'Dr. Martinez discusses how economic education needs to evolve to prepare citizens for modern economic challenges.',
    content: `Q: Dr. Martinez, you've been advocating for changes in how we teach economics. What's driving this?

    A: Our economic education is still largely based on models from the 20th century, but our economy has fundamentally transformed. Students learn about perfect competition and rational actors, but graduate without understanding platform economics, behavioral biases, or environmental externalities. We're preparing them for an economy that no longer exists.

    Q: How should economic education evolve?

    A: We need to integrate insights from behavioral economics, which recognizes that humans don't always make rational decisions. We should teach about digital economies and their unique characteristics. And crucially, we must embed sustainability throughout the curriculum, not treat it as an optional add-on. Economics doesn't happen in a vacuum—it's embedded in our social and environmental contexts.

    Q: Does this mean abandoning traditional economic principles?

    A: Not at all. Supply and demand, opportunity cost, comparative advantage—these concepts remain valuable. But we need to contextualize them and acknowledge their limitations. A well-rounded economic education should include different schools of thought, from Keynesian to Austrian to ecological economics.

    Q: How does this relate to economic citizenship?

    A: Economic citizenship requires understanding how systems work so you can effectively participate in them. If citizens don't understand how modern economies function—including digital markets, global supply chains, and environmental impacts—they can't make informed decisions as consumers, workers, investors, or voters.

    Q: What about economic education outside of universities?

    A: That's equally important. We need better financial literacy programs in schools, workplace education on economic trends affecting specific industries, and public education campaigns about economic policies. Libraries and community centers can host workshops on practical economic skills. Media has a responsibility to explain economic concepts clearly instead of relying on jargon.

    Q: What gives you hope for the future?

    A: I'm encouraged by the growing interest in pluralistic economics, especially among young people. They're asking how economics can address climate change, inequality, and well-being—not just GDP growth. The pandemic also forced many people to think more deeply about economic interconnections and vulnerabilities. There's a real appetite for economic education that reflects the world we actually live in.`,
